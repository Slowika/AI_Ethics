    "\n",
    "1. Download 'wiki-news-300d-1M.vec.zip' and 'wiki-news-300d-1M-subword.vec.zip' from https://fasttext.cc/docs/en/english-vectors.html\n",
    "2. Put both files in a subfolder titled 'wiki-en'\n",
    "3. Install *gensim* to your virtual environment 'pip install gensim' if has not already been installed\n",
    "4. Make sure that you have the 'test.py' file in the same directory as this notebook\n",
    "5. Run the first cell (this will take a while because the vec files are big)\n",
    "\n",
    "See 'ft_test_1.ipynb' for usage examples"
